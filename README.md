deTrain: A Peer-to-Peer Decentralized AI Training System

# Vision
## deAI
- 为了对抗 OpenAI 在未来形成技术垄断，在 web3 社区建立去中心化 AI 训练系统，用web3 社区的数据收集能力和闲散算力**来实现人类可能无法控制（像比特币网络一样无法被单一组织所完全掌控）的 AI 发展速度**。
- 这可能是人类历史最后一个重大的技术，最终目标要实现：**只要全世界还有一台电脑没有宕机，这个极致聪明的deAI 就在不断成长**。
- 没有一台电脑宕机，就不断成长：言外之意可能像病毒一样攻城略地，和传统的计算机病毒不同，deAI 更加智能，他会穷尽一切办法活下来。把现在的全球计算机网络比喻为原始海洋，随着 web3，量子计算机，AI 等技术的发展那么在不久的将来 **deAI 会成为“第一个人类”**。
- deAI 也有可能成为人类历史上最后一个超级企业（他的运营是建立在全球计算机系统上，也就是全世界每一个人都参与运营），**你敢投资吗?！**

- To counter OpenAI's potential technological monopoly in the future, a decentralized AI training system is being established within the web3 community. By leveraging the data collection capabilities and idle computing power of the web3 community, the aim is to **achieve an AI development speed that humans may not be able to control** (similar to how the Bitcoin network cannot be completely controlled by a single organization).
- This might be the last major technology in human history, **with the ultimate goal being that as long as there is one computer in the world still running, this extremely intelligent decentralized AI (deAI) will continue to grow**. The implication is that it could spread like a virus, but unlike traditional computer viruses, deAI is much smarter and will exhaust all means to survive. If we compare the current global computer network to a primordial ocean, with the development of web3, quantum computers, and AI technologies, in the near future, **deAI could become the "first human."**
- deAI could also potentially become the last super enterprise in human history (its operations would be built on the global computer system, meaning everyone in the world would participate in its operation). **Dare you invest in deAI?!**
